# Laughfy

Welcome to **Laughfy**! designed to create a fun, interactive jokes platform. Laughfy allows users to submit, view, and moderate jokes across multiple joke categories, all powered by a scalable, microservices-based architecture.

## Overview

The **Laughfy** platform is composed of four main services:

1. **Deliver Jokes Microservice**: Provides random jokes on demand, allowing users to select from a variety of joke types.
2. **Moderate Jokes Microservice**: Allows moderators to review, edit, and approve or reject user-submitted jokes. This service includes basic authentication to secure moderator actions.
3. **Submit Jokes Microservice**: Enables users to submit new jokes and categorize them by type. No authentication is required for submissions.
4. **Jokes Frontend**: A Next.js-based frontend application where users can view random jokes, submit new jokes, and interact with the backend services in a friendly, intuitive interface.

---

## Repositories

Each service has its own repository within the Laughfy organization, designed for modular development, deployment, and scaling:

- **[deliver-jokes-microservice](https://github.com/Laughfy/deliver-jokes-microservice)**: Built with Nest.js, this service handles joke retrieval, including filtering by joke type.
- **[moderate-jokes-microservice](https://github.com/Laughfy/moderate-jokes-microservice)**: An Express.js-based microservice with authentication, allowing moderators to review and manage submitted jokes.
- **[submit-jokes-microservice](https://github.com/Laughfy/submit-jokes-microservice)**: Developed with Nest.js (or Express.js), this service enables public joke submissions categorized by type.
- **[jokes-frontend](https://github.com/Laughfy/jokes-frontend)**: A Next.js (TypeScript) application that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with all backend services.

## Architecture

The Laughfy platform uses a **microservices architecture**. Each backend service is containerized, making it easier to deploy, manage, and scale as independent units. The frontend interacts with the backend microservices through RESTful APIs.

### Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Nest.js, Express.js, Node.js
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Getting Started

Each repository includes detailed setup instructions in its own README. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Clone the Repositories**: Clone each repository locally or as submodules in a parent project if desired.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Each service uses environment variables (e.g., `.env` files) for configuration, such as API URLs and authentication keys.
3. **Build and Run Containers**: Each microservice has a Dockerfile for easy containerization. Follow the instructions to build and run containers independently.
4. **Access the Frontend**: The frontend application provides a unified interface for interacting with the backend services.
